# MRST Simulations

My various reservoir simulations done in Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST)

Simple 3D homogeneous/heterogeneous models:

1. Single-phase incompressible fluid (water) simulation (ALL B.C.)
2. Single-phase compressible fluid (oil) simulation - constant viscosity over pressure (NO FLOW B.C.)
3. Single-phase compressible fluid (gas) simulation - pressure-dependent viscosity (NO FLOW B.C.)
4. Single-phase compressible fluid (polymer) simulation - Non-Newtonian fluid (with 2 numerical methods: cell-based, or face-based) (NO FLOW B.C.)
5. Single-phase compressible fluid (oil) simulation - constant viscosity over pressure (NO FLOW B.C.)
6. Single-phase compressible fluid simulation with thermal effects (NO FLOW B.C.)
